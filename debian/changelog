    - Use DEB_VERSION_UPSTREAM from dpkg-pkg-info.mk instead of parsing

  * New upstream release.
  * Versioning scheme has been changed to better work with upstream's

      Makes use of the new versioning scheme

 -- Christian Kastner <ckk@debian.org>  Sun, 01 Nov 2015 17:14:30 +0100

  * Add package python3-liblinear.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6 (no changes needed)

    thereby fixing a FTBFS. Closes: #790248
  * debian/copyright:
    - Bump copyright years

 -- Christian Kastner <debian@kvr.at>  Wed, 22 Jul 2015 17:11:54 +0200

liblinear (1.8+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Migrate repo to Debian-Science at git.debian.org
  * debian/control:
    - Update Vcs-* URLs to point to new location
    - Add XS-Testsuite for autopkgtest
    - python-liblinear is arch:all, not arch:any. Thanks, Vincent Cheng

  * debian/patches (updated):
    - 0006-Improve-option-parsing
      Fix wrong function call in float parsing (for epsilon value, etc.). As a
      result of copy-pasta, strtol() was being used where strtof() was needed.

liblinear (1.8+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/symbols:
    - Declare an empty virtual destructor as optional symbol; gcc-4.9 no longer

  * debian/control:
    - Add Multi-Arch fields to packages where necessary
    - Add Pre-Depends for package liblinear1
  * debian/rules:

    - Update paths as a consequence of the new install target and
      multi-arch-ification
  * debian/patches (updated):
    - 0001-Properly-build-shared-and-static-libraries-programs

      destinations for libraries and executables

liblinear (1.8+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Demoted liblinear1's Recommends for liblinear-tools to Suggests, so
      packages depending only on the library don't pull in the tools.
      Closes: #682062
    - Demoted liblinear-tools' Recommends for libsvm-tools to Suggests, for the
      same reasons. Closes: #679992
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed)
    - Bumped debhelper compatibility version to recommended level 9
    - Dropped dependency on python-support, and added a dependency on
      python-all-dev (>= 2.6.6-3~) for dh_python2, as well as added
      X-Python-Version >= 2.5. Closes: #679993
    - Updated BLAS dependency to libblas-dev | libblas.so, the currently
      recommended approach.
  * debian/compat:
    - Raised debhelper compatibility level to recommended level 9
  * debian/rules:
    - Converted to dh_python2
    - Fixed get-orig-rules target in debian/rules. The generated tarball did
      not match the git version
    - Use DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND, as recommended, instead of CFLAGS
  * debian/copyright:
    - Updated to machine-readable copyright format 1.0
  * debian/gbp.conf
    - Created (package is based on dfsg branch, not upstream)
  * debian/patches (new):
     - 0006-Improve-option-parsing
       Use optarg, avoid atoi, verify argument count. Closes: #716115
  * debian/patches (modified):
    - 0001-Properly-build-shared-and-static-libraries-programs
      Include CPPFLAGS to avoid hardening flag warnings
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    - Added override for debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature
  * debian/*.lintian-overrides:
    - Added overrides for no-upstream-changelog

liblinear (1.8+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Added Chen-Tse Tsai <ctse.tsai@gmail.com> to Uploaders
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed)
  * debian/python-liblinear.install
    debian/rules:
    - Dropped the override for dh_install in favor of python-liblinear.install
      Previously, this was not possible because we had to rename files
  * debian/watch:
    - Rewrote version mangling. Now only the upstream version needs to be
      mangled. The previous approach didn't work well together with DEHS
  * debian/copyright:
    - Refreshed upstream's copyright
    - Fixed the previous refresh of my packaging copyright (don't drop 2010)
    - Refreshed DEP5 format to r173
  * debian/python-liblinear.README.Debian
    - Refreshed to reflect that we are now upstream-compatible again
  * debian/patches refreshed:
    - 0001-Properly-build-shared-and-static-libraries-programs
      Fixed a (harmless) missing definition. Also, patch now applies against
      orig tarball created with get-orig-source. The orig tarball previously
      created manually differed slightly (whitespace in Makefile)
  * debian/patches dropped (implemented/included upstream):
    - 0003-Add-missing-solver-to-Python-bindings
    - 0004-Python-namespace-change.patch
  * debian/patches added:
    - 0005-Documentation-fix.patch
      Mismatch between documented formulas

 -- Christian Kastner <debian@kvr.at>  Tue, 05 Apr 2011 14:23:37 +0200

liblinear (1.7+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #609380
  * python-liblinear:
    - NAMESPACE CHANGE. In anticipation of upstream's namespace switch for the
      next release, our own namespace switch (which broke compatibility) was
      modified to conform to it.
    - Added NEWS file indicating namespace change
    - Updated README.Debian indicating namespace change
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes needed)
    - Modified Depends: of liblinear-dev to support alternative BLAS
      implementations
    - Fixed broken Vcs-Browser URL.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Refreshed DEP5-format to r166
    - Refreshed copyrights
    - Added Disclaimer for the modifications made during DFSG-cleaning
    - Relicense all of my contributions to BSD-3-clause to facilitate possible
      inclusions in upstream
  * debian/liblinear1.symbols:
    - Added new symbols
    - Removed the unnecessary dfsg suffix
  * debian/rules:
    - Added target get-orig-source
    - Don't hardcode CFLAGs; honor dpkg-buildflags
    - On systems with a dpkg-dev (<< 1.15.6), the symbols file is removed prior
      before dh_makeshlibs runs. This is a convenience solution for backporters
      on platforms where the c++ tags would otherwise cause build failures.
      This is temporary solution.
  * debian/patches:
    - Added 0003-Add-missing-solver-to-Python-bindings
    - Dropped 0002-Move-Python-bindings-to-package-liblinear
    - Added 0004-Python-namespace-change.patch
      (i.e., the old namespace switch was dropped, and the new one implemented
      as a fresh patch)
