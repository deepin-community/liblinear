liblinear for Debian
--------------------

For more information (including formulations) about LIBLINEAR, you are strongly
advised to read upstream's README file in /usr/share/doc/liblinear4/README.

Upstream calls its binary executables "train" and "predict". To avoid possible
name collisions, these binaries (available in the liblinear-tools package) have
been renamed to "liblinear-train" and "liblinear-predict".
