README for python3-liblinear
============================

Upstream's physical commonutil.py has been merged into liblinearutil.py.

In practice, liblinearutil was already importing all from commonutil, so unless
you were importing commonutil directly, you should not even notice this change.

If you were importing commonutil directly, simply import liblinearutil instead.
